Dashter

2/15/2015 - Hi! Please note, the Dashter plugin has not functioned since December of 2012, when Twitter changed their API. However, you may find some of the code interesting and worth poking around. Also please note this was built to support WordPress 3, so newer versions may not work either. 

One more note - Dashter required receiving the Dashter API token for the main app from the Dashter.com server, which is no longer available. So, in the code where it references tokens, those will no longer work. It's pretty messy in there. Sorry for the hassle!
